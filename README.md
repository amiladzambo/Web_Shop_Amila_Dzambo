# Web_Shop_Amila_Dzambo
# This is a Web Shop project I did for our class at the University. For the backend, I used Node.js. I did frontend in EJS, and I used the PostgreSQL database.
This website is for the customers to find and order products from shops of various kinds and for the merchants to create their online shop to put up and sell their 
products. The application allows all types of shops(clothes, technology, markets, etc.) and customer services(instructions, repairman, etc.). There are three variants of 
users: main administrator, merchant, and customer.

The main administrator has access to all the merchants and customers registered to the website. He can edit(block, activate, deactivate) their accounts and access the
application's statistics(number of merchants, number of customers, number of orders, etc.). He can search, look and delete merchant's products if necessary.

The merchant is a user who registers his shop by inserting the required information. He can log in and edit his profile(username, profile image, cover image, email, 
etc.) at any time, add new products to the shop, delete or edit the existing ones. He can very easily find his product through a search input. Notifications appear every
time someone orders something from his shop. He can decline or accept the order and he always has information about all the orders placed as well as information on his 
earnings. 

The customer is a user who registers into the app by inserting the required information. After log in, his front-page contains the most popular products, products recommended based on his inserted interests, and some random recommended products. He can easily search for any product and shop through a search input. Customers can search shop profiles, list through the shop's catalog, and place orders. He gets an email about his order's status for every order He places and has access to the information on all the orders He created. He has the right to rate every shop and every product. 

Customers, merchants, and the main admin can communicate with one another through a chat.
